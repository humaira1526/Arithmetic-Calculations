# Arithmetic calculations

I have worked on this project in my introductory programming class- python. The this project, the program will ask the user to enter a difficulty level and choose addition/subtraction/multiplication/division to practice on. If the user chooses difficulty level one, the program will create questions with only one number, such as "what is 9-2?" and if the user chooses difficulty level 2, the program will ask questions with numbers in 2 units, such as  "what is 23+56?" This program will continue until the the user decides to end it by pressing -1.
